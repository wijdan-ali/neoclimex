# What Is Neoclimex?
<ul>
  <li>A student-built Al tool predicting equilibrium temperatures of exoplanets (perhaps our next home)</li>
  <li>A proof that meaningful tools can be built without degrees or labs</li>

# Why Is It Useful?
<ul>
  <li>Offers quick climate profiling for early research and hypothesis building</li>
  <li>Helps estimate if an exoplanet is earth-like</li>
  <li>Acts as a baseline model for comparisions with more complex climate simulations</li>
</ul>
